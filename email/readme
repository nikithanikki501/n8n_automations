This project =
“Whenever an order row is updated in Google Sheets → AI writes a custom order email → Email is sent via Gmail automatically.”

Step-by-step process:

1.Google Sheets Trigger

Watches a specific Google Sheet (orders_example → Sheet1) for updates (polls every minute).

2.AI Agent (LangChain + Groq model)

Takes the updated row data (OrderID, Name, Product, Quantity, Price, Order Status).

Generates a professional email using AI (Groq LLM) with "Dinesh Logistics" as the company name.

3.Structured Output Parser

Ensures the AI’s response is structured into two fields:

subject (email subject)

body (email body)

4.Gmail Node

Sends the generated email to dineshpilla26@gmail.com.

Subject = AI’s generated subject

Body = AI’s generated body
